  "about": " Hi there! My name is Joseph and this is my Online Project Portfolio! I am pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science at Concordia University in Montreal. I also completed a technical degree in Computer Science at John Abbott College. Over the course of the past couple years, I have created many projects, personal and group projects with my classmates and friends. This portfolio will showcase some of the projects I am most proud of and ones that I am working on :) \n\nMost of my projects will go here but you can hear more from me on my LinkedIn: **https://www.linkedin.com/in/joseph-ambayec/**\n\nAlso, I would like to credit the person who made this amazing website template!
