    "about": " Hi there! My name is Joseph and this is my Online Project Portfolio! I am a third year Computer Science student at John Abbott College in Montreal. Over the course of the past couple years, I have created many projects, personal and group projects with my classmates. This portfolio will showcase some of the projects I am most proud of and one that I am working on :) \n\nMost of my projects will go here but you can hear more from me on my website: **https://www.josephambayec.dev**\n\nAlso, I would like to credit the person who made this amazing website template. Here is their Github: **https://github.com/mayankagarwal09**",
